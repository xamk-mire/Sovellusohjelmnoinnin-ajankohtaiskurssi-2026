## Sprint goal

From the tickets: ship a runnable skeleton so later sprints can focus on features. You are done when Compose starts `db`, `api`, and `web`; `GET /health` returns JSON; the frontend opens; the README covers clone → `.env` → Compose → URLs.

In your words (2–3 sentences): did you meet that, and what is still rough?

## Tickets

For **each** ticket fill **Status** and **PR / commit**.

Fill **Demonstration** only where this template includes that section. Follow the numbered steps exactly. Store images under `docs/reports/images/sprint-01/` using the suggested filename. Crop secrets.

For **every** ticket: set **Used AI?** to `Yes` or `No`. Write the sprint-level **AI usage** reflection at the end of this report (not under each ticket).

Skip stretch tickets you did not do. Stretch: Status, PR, and Used AI? for each stretch you did; add a Demonstration only where listed below.

## How we worked

Sprint 1 is **two weeks**.

- **Week 1** (backend shell & Compose):
- **Week 2** (frontend shell & README):
- Who did what:
- One blocker and how you unblocked it:

## Decisions

Two to four technical choices with why (for example Vite in Compose vs build + nginx).

1.
2.

## What we learned

Note what you actually used. Tools this sprint: Git / monorepo, Python venv + `requirements.txt`, FastAPI + Uvicorn, OpenAPI (`/docs`), Pydantic / pydantic-settings, PostgreSQL, Docker Compose, React + TypeScript + Vite, React Router, `.env` / `.env.example`.

- What clicked:
- One thing you would do differently:

## Carry-over

Deferred Must/Should, stretch leftovers, risks for [Sprint 2 tickets](../tickets/sprint-02-tickets.md) (auth, catalog, SQLAdmin).

## AI usage (sprint-level reflection)

Mark **Used AI?** under each ticket above (`Yes` / `No`). Do **not** write per-ticket reflections there.

Here, cover your **overall** AI use during this sprint (Cursor, ChatGPT, Copilot, local coding assistants, etc.). Product Insights via Ollama in Sprint 5 does **not** count unless you also used an AI assistant to write code.

If you marked **No** on every ticket, write a short note that you did not use AI coding assistants this sprint (you may still answer verification / independence questions briefly).

- **Where AI helped most this sprint** (themes, ticket IDs, or areas—not a ticket-by-ticket dump):
- **What I typically accepted from AI suggestions:**
- **What I typically rejected or reworked, and why:**
- **How I verified AI-assisted work** (tests, `/docs`, manual demos, reviews):
- **What I can now explain or do independently** that I relied on AI for earlier:
- **Anything I would do differently with AI next sprint:**

Do not paste secrets, full JWTs, or `.env` values.
